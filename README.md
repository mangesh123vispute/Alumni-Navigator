# Alumni-Navigator

Alumni-Navigator is a Django project that aims to address the challenge of tracking and managing the alumni of a college or university effectively. It provides a mechanism to keep records of students who have graduated, including their employment status and other relevant information.

## Problem Definition

One of the common challenges faced by educational institutions is the inability to track the progress and status of their alumni. Colleges and universities often maintain only basic information, such as admission details, and do not have real-time data on their alumni's employment status or other critical information. Manually updating and managing this information is a time-consuming and cumbersome process.

## Features

- **Alumni Database**: Store and manage detailed information about alumni, including academic details, personal information, employment status, and job details.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Enable alumni to update their employment status and other information, ensuring the database remains current.

- **Easy Management**: Simplify the process of maintaining and updating alumni records for colleges and universities.

- **Search and Reporting**: Easily search for alumni based on various criteria and generate reports.
